Leaders Playbook was created out of a need in my job as the kitchen director at Chick-fil-A.  As directors, we are responsible for creating "playbooks" for different projects in our area, so I began creating a playbook
web app, and that evelved into a web app that could handle all the resonsibilities we had as leaders such as creating schedules, tracking our playbook progress, and sending out info to our team memebers.
